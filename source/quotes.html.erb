              "As the first PaaS offering to embrace Docker natively, Red Hat's OpenShift 3.0 platform-as-a-service will achieve significant adoption in enterprises in 2015 for three reasons. Not only is OpenShift the easiest path yet for enterprises to take advantage of container technology inside their data centers, but with their OpenShift Commons initiative, they are providing the entire eco-system around OpenShift with an open peer-to-peer network to exchange and collaborate on all aspects of this latest release.  We're pleased to be active participants in the OpenShift Commons and encourage others to join." - Avi Cavale, CEO & Co-founder of Shippable
